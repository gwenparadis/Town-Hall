## TOWN HALL
## Description
This application is an interactive and user friendly online Town Hall where the user can create posts and react to posts created by other users. 

## Technologies Used
We used Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTSful API. 
We used Handlebars.js as the templating engine, and we used MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.  For CSS/styling we used Tailwind/daisyUI, and we used placeimg.com for the random image generator.
We used Insomnia to test routes and Workbench to test models, relationships, and queries. We used Github to host our repository and Heroku to deploy our solution.
